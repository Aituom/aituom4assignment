            De Morgan was a British mathematician and logician. He formulated De
            Morgan's laws and introduced the term mathematical induction, making
            its idea rigorous.
            <p>
              Augustus De Morgan was born in Madurai, India in 1806.[a] His
              father was Lieut.-Colonel John De Morgan (1772–1816), who held
              various appointments in the service of the East India Company. His
              mother, Elizabeth Dodson (1776–1856), was a descendant of James
              Dodson, who computed a table of anti-logarithms (inverse
              logarithms).
            </p>
            <p>
              Augustus De Morgan became blind in one eye a month or two after he
              was born. The family moved to England when Augustus was seven
              months old. As his father and grandfather had both been born in
              India, De Morgan used to say that he was neither English, nor
              Scottish, nor Irish, but a Briton "unattached", using the
              technical term applied to an undergraduate of Oxford or Cambridge
              who is not a member of any one of the Colleges.
