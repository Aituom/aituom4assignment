            Jakob was first of the Bernoulli family of Swiss mathematicians.He
            was born in Switzerland. He introduced the first principles of the
            calculus of variation. Bernoulli numbers, a concept that he
            developed, were named for him.
            <p>
              The scion of a family of drug merchants, Jakob Bernoulli was
              compelled to study theology but became interested in mathematics
              despite his father’s opposition. His travels led to a wide
              correspondence with mathematicians.
            </p>
            Refusing a church appointment, he accepted a professorial chair of
            mathematics at the University of Basel in 1687; and, following his
            mastery of the mathematical works of John Wallis, Isaac Barrow ,
            René Descartes , and G.W. Leibniz, who first drew his attention to
            calculus, he embarked upon original contributions.
            <p>
              In 1690 Bernoulli became the first to use the term integral in
              analyzing a curve of descent. His 1691 study of the catenary, or
              the curve formed by a chain suspended between its two extremities,
              was soon applied in the building of suspension bridges. In 1695 he
              also applied calculus to the design of bridges.
