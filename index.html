            Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevskii The Russian mathematician Nikolai
            Ivanovich Lobachevskii (1792-1856) was one of the first to found an
            internally consistent system of non-Euclidean geometry. His
            revolutionary ideas had profound implications for theoretical
            physics, especially the theory of relativity.
            <p>
              In 1807 Lobachevskii entered Kazan University to study medicine.
              However, the following year Johann Martin Bartels, a teacher of
              pure mathematics, arrived at Kazan University from Germany. He was
              soon followed by the astronomer J. J. Littrow. Under their
              instruction, Lobachevskii made a permanent commitment to
              mathematics and science. He completed his studies at the
              university in 1811, earning the degree of master of physics and
              mathematics.
            </p>
            In 1812 Lobachevskii finished his first paper, "The Theory of
            Elliptical Motion of Heavenly Bodies." Two years later he was
            appointed assistant professor at Kazan University, and in 1816 he
            was promoted to extraordinary professor. In 1820 Bartels left for
            the University of Dorpat (now Tartu in Estonia), resulting in
            Lobachevskii's becoming the leading mathematician of the university.
            He became full professor of pure mathematics in 1822, occupying the
            chair vacated by Bartels.
